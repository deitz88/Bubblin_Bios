    "Name": "Black Molly",
    "ScientificName": "N/a - Captivity Breed Only",
    "Size": "6 - 15 cm (3.5 to 6 inches).",
    "Location": "Black mollies do not appear in the wild.",
    "Diet": "Primarily herbivorous. Will take any and all fish foods, but the diet should be largely based on algae and other plant material. You will notice that this molly can often be seen nipping at air hoses and other surfaces at the bio-film layer.",
    "Details": "Black mollies are very popular aquarium fish, and thus have been heavily bred in the aquarium trade. They are great fish for beginners, and are very unique for their all black apperance.",

    "Name": "Red Shoulder Dwarf Cichlid",
    "ScientificName": "Apistogramma macmasteri",
    "Size": "3 - 8 cm (1.5 to 3 inches).",
    "Location": "Colombia (basins of the Rio Meta river system).",
    "Diet": "Primarily carnivores. A diet made up of various high quality protein based flake foods, sinking pellet foods and frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia or other mixed freshwater preparations are ideal. Variety is key to vibrant colors and overall health of these fish.",
    "Details": "Due to the popularity of this fish, the Red shoulder apisto is readily available through commercial farming. Unlike some of the other apistogrammas, both male and female Red shoulder apistos are quite striking! Their bodies are tan with many dark markings throughout, with some iridescent blue markings in the face and the distinct vibrant red shoulder patch in which they get their name for. This red shoulder patch extends a little further down the body in males than in females. Additionally, especially during spawning behavior, males will be slightly more colorful than females. The dorsal and anal fins of males also get more pointed. More subordinate males will show muted coloration in the presence of a dominant male. Even though apistogrammas are cichlids, they are very peaceful (with the exception of territoriality during spawning) and are popular choices for planted and community aquariums. These fish are obligate bottom dwellers, and will almost entirely ignore fish in all other regions of the aquarium. Either a single male Red shoulder apisto, a male – female pair, or a male with a harem of females is generally recommended per aquarium. An adult Red shoulder apisto can reach a size of approximately 2-1/2″ to 3″, with males averaging larger than females.",

    "Name": "Kuhli Loach",
    "ScientificName": "Pangio semicincta",
    "Size": "6 - 13 cm (2 to 5 inches).",
    "Location": "Southeast Asia (Indonesia, etc.)",
    "Diet": "Omnivores. Opportunistic scavangers. A diet made up of various high quality vegetable based and protein based flake foods, tablet foods or sinking pellet foods are ideal, in addition to offering frozen foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp and other mixed freshwater preparations.",
    "Details": "The Striped Kuhli Loach is native to regions of southeast Asia, however the majority of individuals within the aquarium trade are sourced from aquaculture. Identified by their eel-like body with interchangeable yellow and dark brown bands, the Striped kuhli loach adds a unique presence and look into the community aquarium. Their striped pattern can easily distinguish them from the Black Kuhli Loach (Pangio kuhlii). Kuhli loach are social, and will not hide as much when kept in groups of 4 or more individuals. Additionally, strong and bright lighting can make your Striped kuhli loach take cover until it has adjusted to its new environment. The average Striped kuhli loach can reach an adult size of approximately 4″.",

    "Name": "Black Line Torpedo Loach",
    "ScientificName": "Nemacheilus longistriatus",
    "Size": "5 - 12 cm (2-5 inches)",
    "Location": "Thailand and Southeast Asia (Mekong River)",
    "Diet": "Omnivores. The bulk of their diet consists of small insects, worms, crustaceans and other zooplankton with only relatively small amounts of plant matter consumed, mostly via the stomach contents of prey items.",
    "Details": "They get their name Nemacheilus: from the Greek nēma, meaning ‘thread’ or ‘filament’ and cheilos, meaning ‘lip’ in reference to the furrowed lip in members of this genus. Has been collected from the Mekong main river channel as well as backwaters with substrates of bedrock or sand.\n\nLittle else is known about its ecology but it may enter temporarily flooded regions when water levels rise.",

    "Name": "Bristlenose Pleco",
    "ScientificName": "Ancistrus cirrhosus",
    "Size": "10 - 15 cm (4-6 inches)",
    "Location": "South America",
    "Diet": "Primarily  herbivorous. They feed on algae and other plant matter, which makes them excellent natural algae eaters in aquariums. In addition to algae, they may accept commercial sinking pellets, blanched vegetables (like zucchini or cucumber), and other plant-based foods.",
    "Details": "Bristlenose Plecos are named after the fleshy tentacles (bristles) present on their snouts. These bristles are more pronounced in males, giving them a distinctive appearance. The bristles are used for sensory purposes and are believed to play a role in communication and territorial displays.             They are a very common aquarium species, and are one of the smallest plecos, as regular plecos can grow to be many feet long!",

    "Name": "Assassin Snail",
    "ScientificName": "Clea helena",
    "Size": "2 - 2.5 cm (.75 to 1 inch)",
    "Location": "Southeast Asia (Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia)",
    "Diet": "Carnivorous. They are highly effective at preying on and consuming other snails, particularly pest snails like pond snails and Malaysian trumpet snails. They use their long siphon to hunt and feed on the soft parts of their prey.",
    "Details": "Assassin Snails are generally solitary creatures and prefer to be alone. They are not social snails and usually do not interact with other snails, except during mating. They are frequently used in freshwater aquarium setups to help control/prevent pest snail infestations. While solitary, they can be seen engaging in courting or mating behaviors (atatching to anothers shell on top, etc.) while determining compatability. If so, they mate, otherwise they go back to their solitary lifestyle.",

    "Diet": "Omnivorous and will readily accept a variety of foods. Their diet should include high-quality flakes, pellets, small live or frozen foods like brine shrimp or daphnia, and vegetable matter. They also enjoy grazing on algae and biofilm.",
    "Details": "In the wild, Harlequin Rasboras are known to display a shimmering effect as they school together, creating a mesmerizing sight.\n\nHarlequin Rasboras are a great addition to community aquariums due to their peaceful nature and eye-catching appearance. Keeping them in a well-maintained and appropriately sized aquarium with compatible tank mates will ensure they thrive and display their natural behaviors.",
