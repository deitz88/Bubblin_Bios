In the front left, there is a small cave feature. The Java Ferns in this tank are also mostly comprised of fibrous particles to make structures (one looks like a ball, one a tree!)",
    "Temperature": "Ideal ~75\u00B0 - 77\u00B0 degrees fahrenheit",
    "Details": "This tank has struggled with high bioloads, hence the initial two filtration system. This is a 'community' tank, where there are a wide variety of fish, as opposed to specialized tank setups for 'monster' fish or specific species/schools. The mesh-top provides a high level of gas exchange which helps oxygenate the water properly, but this also leads to faster evaporation. This tank will evaporate about 1/4 - 1/2 of an inch per day. Water changes are crucial for these tanks, and a 20-25% water change is done bi-weekly. This helps reduce the bio-load in the tank, give fresh nutrients and minerals for the ecosystem, and remove unwanted particulates. This is also the time to clean the gravel and substrate of the tank."

    "Details": "This tank will be a very slow growing reef/coral tank. It houses a variety of corals, 2 anemones, and currently one sea slug (who appeared out of nowhere one day! we assume he hitched a ride with one of the anemones). Corals, anemones, and some of the fish are used to lower wavelengths of light, hence the blue light (longest wavelength, can travel the furthest in water). A lovely side-effect of this is all the wonderful glowing features on all the creatures in here."
